# GREEK-ENGLISH VOCABULARY.

NOTE.—(i.) Verbs are given under the Pres. Infin., except in the case of ἔρχομαι (and compounds), which has no Pres. Infin. in Attic Prose.

(ii.) If the Pres. Infin. in -ειν has a circumflex accent, e.g., ἀγνοεῖν, the verb is conjugated like ποιεῖν.

(iii.) If a tense is inserted after the Pres. without mention of the voice, it is implied that the meaning of this tense is the same in voice as that of the Pres., e.g., διανοεῖσθαι (Aor. διενοήθην), intend; ἁλίσκεσθαι (Aor. ἑᾱ́λων), be captured. διενοήθην means I intended; ἑάλων means I was captured.

(iv.) The insertion of the case which a verb governs does not imply that the verb cannot also be used absolutely, e.g., ἀντέχειν resist (Dat.). It is possible to say, ἀντεῖχον they offered resistance, as well as, τοῖς πολεμίοις ἀντεῖχον they resisted the enemy.
