## Part 1

### INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO SECTIONS 1 AND 2 
During the first few lessons, while the Greek Alphabet [REF] and the portions of Grammar given below are being learnt, it is intended that these two sections should be used for practice in reading, and should be translated by instalments to the class.

Nouns should be declined *viva voce*, and also on paper, with or without an adjective and the article, *e.g.*, ἡ μικρά γῆ, ἡ χαλεπὴ ὁδός, στενός Ἰσθμός. Similarly the Pres. Ind. of verbs should be conjugated, *e.g.*, ἔχειν.

Attention should be drawn to cognate words in English and Latin (*e.g.*, κόλπ-ος = *gulf*, μέσος = *medius*), and also to the close connection between the terminations of 1st and 2nd Declen. nouns in Latin and Greek.

As occasion arises, emphasis should be laid on (A) the connection between sentences, and (B) the uses of the Article. The rules are collected here for convenience, but, of course, only one or two points will be dealt with in any one lesson.

###### A. 
(i.) Every sentence is connected with its predecessor by a conjunction or connecting particle; of these the commonest are καί *and* [REF]; δέ *but* , unemphatic [REF]; γάρ *for* [REF]; ἀλλά *but*, emphatic [REF]; οὖν *therefore* [REF]; τε *and* [REF]; μέντοι *however* [REF]; ἔπειτα *then* [REF]. Notice that δέ, γάρ, οὖν, τε, μέντοι, do not come first word in the sentence.

(ii.) There is one exception to the above rule. When the demonstrative pronoun οὗτος *this*, or its derivatives οὕτω *thus*, τοιοῦτος *οf such a kind*, sum up what has already been stated, no conjunction is required [REF]; similarly, when the demonstrative pronoun ὅδε *this*, or its derivatives, ὧδε *thus*, τοιόσδε *of such a character*, look forward to what is coming, no conjunction is required with the following sentence [REF].

(iii.) When two words or groups of words are parallel, they may be joined by τε ... καί ... [REF] or καί ... καί ... [REF], *both ... and ...*; in English we seldom use the word *both*, and therefore leave τε untranslated; this is necessarily the case when τε ... καί ... καί ... occurs [REF].

(iv.) When two clauses or sentences are contrasted, μέν ... δέ ..., *on the one hand ... but on the other ...*, are used. μέν (just like τε *both*) looks forward to something which is coming, but δέ connects with what has gone before, and means BUT *on the other hand*, not simply *on the other hand*. The contrast between the μέν clause and the δέ clause, is often so slight that we do not translate μέν at all, and translate δέ by *but*, or even by *and* [REF].
 
πρῶτον μέν *firstly*, is habitually answered by ἔπειτα *secondly*, not by ἔπειτα δέ, as we should expect [REF].

###### B. The uses of the Article. 
(See also headings to Ex. 1-6.)

(i.) It is habitually used with the names of countries, islands and towns, ἡ Ἑλλάς *Greece* [REF]; ἡ Εὔβοια *Euboea* [REF]; αἱ Ἀθῆναι *Athens*; and with Proper Nouns, if the person is well known or has previously been mentioned, ὁ Πέλοψ *Pelops* [REF].

(ii.) It is used as an unemphatic possessive pronoun, διὰ τὸν πλοῦτον *on account of his wealth* [REF]; τὰς πηγὰς ἔχει *has its springs* [REF].

(iii.) It is placed, as in English, before an attributive adjective, or may be repeated with the adjective after the noun, ὁ Κορίνθιος κόλπος *the Corinthian gulf* [REF]; ἐς τὸν κόλπον τὸν Ἰόνιον *into the Ionian gulf* [REF].

(iv.) Instead of an adjective, the attribute may be a prepositional phrase, an adverb, or a genitive case, ἡ πρὸς Βορέαν μοῖρα lit. *the towards-north part*, i.e., *the northern part* [REF]; οἱ γεωργοὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ μεσογείᾳ *the farmers in the interior* [REF]; οἱ νῦν ἐπιχώριοι lit. *the now inhabitants*, i.e., *the present inhabitants* [REF]; ὁ Θουκυδίδης ὁ Ὀλόρου *Thucydides the (son) of Olorus* [REF].

(v.) It is used with abstract nouns, ἡ ἐπιμειξία *communication* [REF]; ὁ κίνδυνος *danger* [REF].

(vi.) It is omitted with a predicated adjective or noun, τῶν νήσων μεγίστη ἐστὶν ἡ Εὔβοια *Euboea is the largest of the islands* [REF].

(vii.) It denotes a whole class, δύο αἰτίαι προάγουσι τοὺς ὑπηκόους ἐς τὸν πόλεμον *two causes lead subject peoples into war* [REF].

(viii.) The Article was originally a demonstrative pronoun, and can be used, if accompanied by μέν or δέ, meaning *he*, *she*, *it* and *they*. This is especially common in expressions like οἱ μέν ... οἱ δέ ... *these ... but those ...*, *some ... but others ...*, οἱ μὲν φίλοι εἰσὶ τῷ Ἑλληνικῷ δήμῳ, οἱ δὲ ξύμμαχοί εἰσι τῶν Τούρκων *some are friendly to the Greek nation, but others are the allies of the Turks* [REF]; τὰ μὲν αἰσχύνην φέρει, ἐκ δὲ τῶν δόξαν λαμβάνουσι *some deeds bring disgrace, but from others they win honour* [REF]. Notice the order when a preposition is used.

oi δέ necessarily comes first in its clause, A. (iv.): oi μέν generally comes first, but may be preceded by a word or group of words which belongs to both clauses, see [REF]. It is not necessary that, when οἱ δέ is used, oi μέν should have preceded, but oi δέ must not refer to the subject of the previous sentence, see [REF].

(ix.) The Article with an adjective, a prepositional phrase, an adverb, or a genitive case, forms a noun-equivalent, οἱ παλαιοί *the ancients* [REF]; ἡ παραθαλάσσιος *the coast* [REF]; τὸ δίκαιον *justice* [REF]; οἱ κάτω *those on the coast* [REF]; οἱ ἐν τῇ μεσογείᾳ *those in the interior* [REF]; οἱ κατ' ἤπειρον *those along the mainland* [REF]; οἱ ἐν τῇ ξυνωμοσίᾳ *the members of the conspiracy* [REF]; οἱ μετ' αὐτοῦ *his companions* [REF]; τὰ ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ *the state of the camp* [REF]; τὰ περὶ τῆς ξυνωμοσίας *the facts about the conspiracy* [REF]; τὰ τῶν Τούρκων *the property of the Turks* [REF].

### Section 1.

1. έστι μέν, ἔχει δέ. Introd. Note A. (iv.).
2. ἡ Ἑλλάς. ίντροδ. Νote B. (i.).
3. αὐτός, -ή, -ό, in the Nom. means *self* (Lat. *ipse*), but the Oblique Cases are also used for the Personal Pronoun, *him, her, it*. αὐτῶν = *earum*.
4. ήπειρος *mainland*; thus the Western coast of Northern Greece was called Epirus in contrast with the adjacent islands.
5. ἡ πρὸς Βορέαν μοῖρα. Introd. Note B. (iv.).
6. χερσόνησος, lit. *dry-land-island*; νῆσος = *island*.
7. ἡ πρὸς μεσημβρίαν *the southern*, μοῖρα is understood in Greek, as *part* is in English.
8. οἱ μὲν παλαιοί. Introd. Note B. (ix.). μέν is answered by δέ in [REF]. 
8. Πελοπόννησον, lit. *island of Pelops*. According to tradition Pelops, the son of Tantalus, came from Lydia and became King of Pisa in Elis; see *Mythological Dictionary*.
9.  ἐκ τῆς Ἀσίας *from Asia*; prepositions meaning *from* take the Gen. in Greek, because the Gen. expresses separation, like the Latin Abl. of separation.
10. αφικόμενος *having come*; Participles are given in the Vocab. as adjectives.
11. ὡς *as*. Thucydides, the son of Olorus, was an Athenian, who wrote the history of the Peloponnesian War (B.C. 431-404).
12. ὁ Ὀλόρου. Introd. Note B. (iv.).

19. τὰς πηγάς *its springs*, *cf*. [REFn].
20. τὸν Ἰόνιον. Introd. Note B. (iii.).
21. διά with Gen. means *through* (as here), or *by means of*; with Acc. it means *on account of*.
22. ἡ ἐπιμειξία *communication*. Introd. Note B. (v.).
23. τοῖς ... παραθαλασσίοις, the Article with a prepositional phrase or with an adjective is equivalent to a noun, *for those in the interior and on the coast*. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
24. μεγίστη *the largest*; the Article is omitted with a *predicated* adjective in Greek. Introd. Note B. (vi.).
25. τε ... καί ... καί. Introd. Note A. (iii.).

### Section 2. 

τὸ δῶρον, [REF] ; Neut. of στενός, μικρός, [REF]; δόξα, [REF]; ὅδε, [REF].

1. κατὰ τήν ἀρχήν *at the beginning*.
2. ὅδε this is declined like the Article with δε added; when it is used with nouns, the Article must also be used immediately before the noun; ὁ πόλεμος ὅδε or ὅδε ὁ πόλεμος *this war*. For exception, see [REFn].
3. οἱ μέν ... οἱ δέ. Introd. Note B. (viii.).
4. κατὰ κώμας ἀτειχίστους *in unfortified villages*. Compound adjectives (ἀ-τείχιστος *un-walled*) have no separate form for the Fem. *Cf*. παραθαλάσσιος, πολυάνθρωπος [REF].
5. οἱ δὲ κάτω *but those on the coast*, the Article with an adverb forming the equivalent of a noun. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
6. κάτω properly *down*. The Greeks spoke of "going *down* to the coast," "*up* into the interior," and "on the *high* seas," just as we do; the coast is regarded as the lowest point.
7. τὸν πλεῖστον τοῦ βίου *the greater part of their livelihood*; the adjective is made to agree in gender with the noun in the (partitive) Genitive.
8. ἡ παραθαλάσσιος sc. γῆ. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
9. ναυτικῷ ὄχλῳ *with a crowd of sailors*; *with* and *by* are expressed in Greek by the Dative, corresponding with the Latin (instrumental) Ablative.
10. οἱ ἐν τῇ μεσογείᾳ. Introd. Note B. (iv.).
11. τούς τε ἄλλους... *to pay tithes of their produce and other taxes*; the English order is the reverse of the Greek order.
12. ὥστε with Ind. introduces a Consecutive Clause, *so that*.
13. δι' ἁρπαγῆς, see [REFn].
14. ὥσπερ κλέπται *as Clephts*. The Clephts (lit. robbers) were those Greeks, who in defiance of the Turkish authorities carried on a predatory warfare from the hills. Many of them were popular heroes, and their existence helped to keep alive the patriotism of the Greeks.
15. τὰ τῶν Τούρκων *the property of the Turks*. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
16. τῶν πρὶν φίλων, see [REF].
17. ὁ κίνδυνος. Introd. Note B. (v.).
18. οὕτω δή *in this way*. δή only emphasises οὕτω, which sums up what precedes. For omission of conjunction, see Introd. Note A. (ii.).

### Section 3.

δεσπότης, [REF].

1. δύο αἰτίαι αἵδε *these two causes*. If a numeral is used, ὅδε does not require the Article to be inserted with the noun, contrary to the rule given on [REF].
2. τοὺς ὑπηκόους *subject peoples* (in general). The Article denotes a whole class. Introd. Note B. (vii.).
3. ἡ τιμωρία τῶν ἀδικιῶν *vengeance for their wrongs*.
4. πρός *against*.
5. διὰ τάδε *for the following reasons*. For the omission of a conjunction in the following sentence, see Introd. Note A. (ii.).
6. πρῶτον μέν is answered by ἔπειτα in [REF]. Introd. Note A. (iv.).
7. ὅτι *that* introduces a noun-clause, after verbs of thinking, knowing, feeling, seeing, saying, etc.
8. αὐτοί *(they) themselves*, cf. [REFn].
9. έχουσι τούς δεσπότας ἀξυνέτους lit. *they have their masters ignorant*, i.e., *the masters they have are ignorant*. ἀξυνέτους is a predicated adjective, and so has no Article. This is the common idiom with ἔχειν
10. ἄδικα πάσχουσιν ὑπό... lit. *suffer unjust things by*, ie., *suffer unjustly at the hands of*. ὑπό with Gen. is the ordinary way of expressing the Agent after Passive Verbs (Lat. *ab* with Abl.); it is also used, as here, with Intransitive Verbs which have a Passive meaning, *are unjustly treated by*.
11. οἷοι τ' εἰσί lit. *are such as to*, i.e., *are able to*; so οἷόν τ' ἐστίν *it is possible*. τε in early Greek was added to Relative words, e.g., ὥστε, and in such cases means nothing at all.
12. δίκην λαμβάνειν παρά... *to take vengeance on*, lit. *to get punishment from*. παρά with Gen. meaning *from* is only used of persons. 
13. οὐδέν... δικαίον *the judges do not care at all either for the laws or for justice*. In Greek two negatives only strengthen one another, provided that the second one is compound. τὸ δίκαιον *justice*. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
14. μετὰ δώρων... *they decide cases with gifts*, i.e., *under the influence of bribes*.
15. εἰσί is understood with ἔμπειροι δέ from the previous clause. In general if a word or group of words is required with two clauses, it is inserted in the first clause and understood in the second.
16. οὕτω. See [REFn].
17. ὧν *of which*; the Rel. Pron. ὅς, ἥ, ὅ is declined in its other cases like the Article with a rough breathing instead of τ, [REF].
18. τὰ μὲν... ἐκ δὲ τῶν. Introd. Note Β. (viii.). 
19. φέρει. Neut. Plurals in Greek take a Singular Verb. This arose from an original use of the Neut. Plur. as a singular collective noun.
20. ἀθάνατον. See [REFn].

### Section 4. 

Past Imperfect of εἶναι, ή; of λύειν, ἔλυον, [REF]. Syllabic Augment, [REF]; Strong Aorist, [REF].

1. κατά *at*, cf. [REF].
2. τοῖς παρά ... *those along the shore of the Black Sea*. Introd. Note B. (iv.). The name Euxine (*hospitable*) was given it to avoid the original ill-omened name of Ἄξενος (*inhospitable*).
3. χαλεπῶς ἔφερον, like Lat. *aegre ferebant*, *were indignant at*. On augment, see [REF].
4. τὴν τῶν Τούρκων ἀρχήν. Introd. Note B. (iv.).
5. ἀποστόλους, the envoys of the conspirators were called Apostles, i.e. messengers.
6. ὅσους ἔπειθον *all whom they persuaded*; the suppressed antecedent of this clause is the object of ξυνάγουσιν.
7. οἱ κατ' ἤρειρον *those on the mainland*. Introd. Note B. (ix.). 
8. καί... καί. Introd. Note A. (iii.).
9. τούς ἐν τῇ ξυνωμοσίᾳ. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
The Philiké Hetairia, or Association of Friends, was the successor of the Philomuse Society, which had as its object the encouragement of Greek literature; in 1815, it became a political society for the purpose of raising an insurrection against the Turks. The members, on being initiated, swore on their knees at dead of night to be faithful to their afflicted country, to labour for her regeneration, not to disclose either the secrets of the society or the name of the person who initiated them, and to put to death their nearest and dearest relations, should they be guilty of treachery. -GORDON.
10. οἱ μέν in contrast with τοῖς δὲ προστάταις, [REF].
11. ἐτούλευον ὅτι *gave their opinion that*. Cf. [REF].
12. χρή is a noun, meaning *necessity*. It is used (with ἐστί understood but never expressed) to mean *it is necessary*. The Past Imperf. is χρῆν (χρὴ ἦν), and the Inf. χρῆναι (χρὴ εἶναι).
13. χρή is understood with κατακαίειν, κτείνειν and ἀναλαμβάνειν. See [REFn].
14. τοῖς προστάταις ἦν γνώμη *the leaders determined*. 
15. πρῶτον μέν... ἔπειτα. Introd. Note A. (iv.). ἐξάγειν ἐς τὸν πόλεμον belongs to both clauses.
16. The provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia form the present kingdom of Roumania. The Hetairists wished the first outbreak to take place in this district because it would be easy for Russia to send troops to their assistance.
17. τε... καί... καί. Introd. Note A. (iii.).
18. ὁρίζει. See [REFn].
19. Constantinople drew its principal supply of food from the rich alluvial plain of these provinces.
20. By the treaty of Bukharest, between Russia and Turkey, the Sultan had undertaken to appoint Christian governors (called Hodospars) over these provinces, and not to keep more than a small number of Turkish troops in them.
21. διέπεμπε, for Augment of verbs compounded with prepositions, see [REF].
22. δ' οὖν *so*, is used after a parenthesis or a digression, resuming the main narrative.
23. πρός *in relation to*, i.e., *for*. 
24. ἔπρασσον πρός... *negotiated with*. Theodore Vladimiresko (so-called because he had received the Russian Order of St. Vladimir) had been a colonel in the Russian army. As he was a Wallachian landowner, he had great influence among the natives.
25. Georgaki (the name is the diminutive of George) was a Greek from Mount Olympus, and at this time in command of the troops at Bukharest. Caravia was captain of the garrison at Galatz.
26. ἔμαθον, for Strong Aorist, see [REF].
27. τὰ περὶ τῆς ξυνωμοσίας. Introd. Note B. (ix.).


### Section 5.

πᾶς, [REF]; *Temporal Augment*, [REF].

1. ῆλθε, for Strong Aorist, see [REF].
2. παντὰ τὰ ἐν τῇ Μολδοβλαχίᾳ *all the arrangements in Roumania*.
3. τὸν Ὑψιλάντην στρατηγὸν προστάξαντες *appointing Hypsilantes general*. Participles in -ας are declined like πᾶς, and are given in the Vocabulary as adjectives.
4.  Prince Alexander Hypsilantes had served in the Russian Imperial Guard, and had lost an arm at the battle of Culm in 1813; after the peace of 1815 he grew weary of inaction and entered warmly into the plans of the Hetairists.
5. ὅς... ἀπέθανε *who had been put to death by the Turks on a charge of treachery*. The Aorist in a subordinate clause often refers to a time which is *past* from the point of view of the main clause; in these cases we use the Pluperfect in English. ὑπό, see [REFn].
6. δ' οὖν. See [REFn].
7. ἐς διακοσίους *to the number of 200*; a common use of ἐς with numerals.
8. ὁμήρους ἔλαβον *seized as hostages*.
9. δεσμοῖς lit. *with chains*, Instrum. Dat. [REFn].
10. πλὴν ὅσοι ἀπέφυγον *except those who had escaped*.
11. πλήν is also used as a Preposition, [REF].
12. ἐπ' ἐλευθερίᾳ *to secure the freedom of the people*.
13. ἥκει... μέλλει, *had come... intended*; notice that in noun-clauses introduced by ὅτι, the original tenses are retained; for instance, in the proclamation Hypsilantes said, *I am come... Russia intends*, therefore the Present tenses are retained, though we translate them by Past tenses. Cf. [REF], and passim.
14. At the end of the proclamation came these words: "If some desperate Turks venture to make an incursion into your territory, fear nothing; for a Great Power is ready to punish their insolence". The "Great Power" was, of course, Russia.
15. Instead of taking military precautions Hypsilantes commenced operations by seizing a wealthy banker whom he accused of being hostile to the Revolution and concealing funds belonging to the Hetairia. The first accusation was not a crime and the second was false; but the banker was glad to pay the prince several thousand pounds to escape out of his hands. This act of extortion alarmed the wealthy citizens, who, afraid of being robbed by the Greeks, availed themselves of every opportunity of escaping into Russia and Austria -FINLAY.
16. ὡς εἶδον *when they saw*. For Augment, see [REF].
17. ενόμιζόν τε *and they thought*; τε is here used as a conjunction, joining two sentences. Introd. Note A. (i.).

19. εκεῖ. Introd. Note B. (iv.).
20. τὰ τῶν ἐμπόρων. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
21. καὶ αὐτοὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ἔπρασσον *themselves too did the same*. Cf. [REFn].
22. αὐτός immediately preceded by the article means *same*.

8. τῷ αὐτῷ, [REFn].
9. ἐν παντὶ δὴ ἀταξίας... lit. *in everything of disorder*, i.e., *in a state of utter disorder and suspicion*. δὴ only emphasises πᾶς, cf. [REF].
10. παρεῖχε, for Augment, see [REF].
11. ὑπήκουον takes either the Gen. (as here) or the Dat. [REF].
12. This Sacred Battalion consisted of about 500 Greeks; their uniform was black with a cross formed of bones in front and Constantine's inscription, *In hoc signo vinces*. -ALISON.

### Section 7. 

Pres. Ind. of ποιεῖν, ποιῶ, [REF].

2. ὑπ' ὀργῆς *angrily*.
3. κρύφα αὐτοῦ *without his knowledge*.
4. Besides disavowing the Insurrection, the Czar (Alexander I.) commanded Hypsilantes "to proceed no further, but on the contrary if possible to disband the unhappy men, whom you have misled". Hypsilantes pretended that the Russian proclamation was only a blind to deceive the Turks, and that the Czar was really sending troops to support him.
5. στρατιᾷ *with an army*; the Instrumental Dative is very common in military phrases, expressing the accompanying force.
6. ὅσα... Καραβιοῦ, see [REFn].
7. ὑπό. See [REFn]. 
8. τὴν τιμωρίαν... αναλαμβάνειν *to take vengeance on those who had committed the crime*. The Participle with the Article is equivalent to a noun, just as an adjective with the Article is; ὁ ἀδικήσας or ὁ ἄδικος = *the wrong-doer*.
9. οἱ μετ' αὐτοῦ lit. *those with him*, i.e., *his troops*. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
10. τοῦ Βουκουρεστίου *from Bukharest*. The Gen. in Greek expresses "separation," *from*, like the Lat. Abl. of Separation. Cf. [REFn].
11. εἷλον, for Augment, see [REF].
12. λαβεῖν... *to receive the governorship as the reward of his treachery*. Cf. [REFn].
13. αὐτομολίᾳ χωρεῖν *to go by desertion*, i.e., *to desert*; αὐτομολίᾳ is Dat. of Manner, like Lat. Abl. of Manner.
14. ὥστε *on condition of*; ὥστε often introduces the terms of an agreement.


### Section 8. 

Past Imperf. of ποιεῖν, ἐποίουν, [REF].

1. εἶναι, Or. Obl., *he said he was disloyal*.
2. ὑπό, [REFn]. Caravia and another officer butchered him in a barbarous way with their sabres.
3. προσεχώρουν... *joined the Turks as deserters*.
4. ες ὀκτακοσίους τινάς *to the number of some eight hundred*. Cf. [REFn].
5. εδόκει τῷ Γεωργάκῃ *it seemed good to Georgaki*, i.e., *G. determined*. One of the reasons for postponing the engagement was the fact that the day was a Tuesday which is regarded as an unlucky day in the East.
6. κύκλῳ *by a circuitous way*.
7. ὥστε with Inf. gives the result, whether it is the actual or only the probable result; with the Ind. it gives the actual result only, [REF]; *so as to cut them off and prevent them escaping*.
8. οὕτω... *in this way they were likely to kill them all*.
9. ἔρρει, for Augment, see [REF].
10. στάδια, the plur. of στάδιον is either στάδια or στάδιοι, [REF].


### Section 9.

1.  Caravia was always reckless, and on this occasion happened to be intoxicated. -GORDON.
2. ήθελε... *he wished the glory of the victory to belong to his men*. εἶναι with Dat. is used to express "*belong to*" or 
"*have*" like Lat. *est mihi liber*, *I have a book*.
1. ἅμα τῇ ἑσπέρᾳ lit. *with the evening*, i.e., *at sunset*.
2. ἅμα is often used as a prep. with words denoting "*time*".
3. ἵππος *horse* is sometimes used as a collective noun, meaning *Cavalry*, just as we speak of So-and-so's Horse meaning "mounted regiment". ἵππος in this sense is fem.
4. εἶδον is plur. because the "battalion" is regarded as "the soldiers"; so too καὶ αὐτοί in [REF]. Verbs of sense-perception (e.g., seeing, knowing, hearing, etc.) take the Acc. and Partic. in Greek, as they may do in English, *saw him advancing*.
5. ἔργον *action*; used in Greek as we use *action* to denote *battle*.
6. θυμῷ καὶ ῥώμῃ *with spirit and confidence*; Dat. of Manner. Cf. [REFn].
7. έμελλον *they were on the point of leaving the village*. Cf. [REFn]. 
8. οἱ ὁπλῖται, *viz*., the troops mentioned in [REF].
9. δρόμῳ, Dat. of Manner. Cf. [REFn].
10. ἔτρεπον *routed them*; τοὺς ἐναντίους is understood from τοῖς ἐναντίοις.
11. ὡς εἰπεῖν *so to speak*; this phrase is used to apologise for an exaggeration; πάντας ὡς εἰπεῖν = *practically all*, not literally all. The Infin. εἰπεῖν is used absolutely, i.e., without any syntactical construction with the sentence.


### Section 10. 

οὗτος, [REF].

1. ταῦτα *this*; οὗτος refers to what precedes, ὅδε refers to what is coming, [REF].
2. ἔτυχον παραστάντες *happened to be standing near*; τυγχάνω takes the Participle where we use the Infinitive.
3. ὅσοι... λόχου, see [REFn].
4. οἱ δέ. Introd. Note B. (viii.).
5. τῷ δ' Ὑψιλάντῃ ἀθυμία ἐνέπεσε *Hypsilantes became disheartened*.

7. τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ, sc. ἡμέρα, *on the next day*. When an event is dated by the particular *day, night, month* or *year* of its occurrence, the Dat. is used without a prep., otherwise the prep. ἐν is used.
8. The proclamation began, "Soldiers! I can hardly bring myself to sully that honourable and sacred name by applying it to persons such as you. Henceforth every bond is severed between us; but I shall ever feel profoundly the shame of having been your chief." -ALISON
9. ἐσπίπτει *is thrown into*; the Passive of compounds of βάλλειν *throw* is formed by the corresponding compounds of πίπτειν *fall*, e.g., ἐκβάλλω *I expel*, ἐκπίπτω *I am expelled*; cf. ἀποκτείνω *I kill*, ἀποθνῄσκω *I am killed*.
10. αἱ ἀρχαί, Abstract for Concrete, *the Austrian authorities*.
11. νόσῳ lit. *by disease*, Instrum. Dat. [REFn], *he fell ill and died*. Hypsilantes was kept as a prisoner until 1827, when he was released, but he died in the following year from the effects of imprisonment in unhealthy fortresses.
12. ἐν goes with ἀπορίᾳ as well as with κινδύνῳ.
13. ἐπ' οἴκου *homewards*, ἐπ' οἶκον *home*; ἐπί with Acc. states where one goes; with Gen. it states the direction only.

φύλαξ, ἀγών, οἰκήτωρ, [REF].

1. τοὺς στρατιώτας is the object of ἀπολείπειν, which can be used transitively, as here, or intransitively [REF] (απολείπειν ἐκ τοῦ ἀγῶνος *to desist from the struggle*).

8. ἔνεον, for uncontracted form, see [REF].
9. ὑπῆρχεν αὐτοῖς lit. *existed for them*, i.e., *they found a refuge*. Cf. [REFn].


### Section 12.
1. επὶ δύο μῆνας *for two months*; Duration of Time is expressed by the Acc. alone [REF] or with ἐπί.
2. τέλος, as adverb, *at last*.
3. Monasteries were often used during the war as fortresses, or places to store ammunition; in some cases the books they contained were destroyed to provide paper for cartridges.
4. νυκτός *by night*. The Acc., Gen. and Dat. are all used to denote time. μέλλει μάχεσθαι τήνδε τὴν νύκτα, νυκτός, τῇδε τῇ νυκτί, *he intends to fight throughout this night, by night, on this night*. The Acc. implies that the fighting and the night last the same length of time; the Gen. implies that the night lasts longer than the fighting; the Dat. disregards duration altogether, and merely states that the night and the fighting occurred together. Cf. [REF].
5. κήρυκα *a man with a flag of truce*.
6. ἄδειαν ποιεῖν *to give a safe conduct to Georgaki and all the others who were there*. The clause ὅσοι... παρῆσαν is equivalent to πᾶσι τοῖς ἔνδον.
7. Georgaki addressed his followers thus: "Brothers, in our present circumstances, a glorious death is all we ought to wish for, and I trust there is no one here base enough to regret his life. Let us imitate those true Greeks our comrades, whose dead bodies are stretched on the fields of Dragashan and Skuleni and whose blood yet cries for vengeance. If we die like them, perhaps on some future day our countrymen will gather up our bones, and transport them to the classic land of our forefathers." -GORDON.
8. πύργον *the belfry*.
9. ἐμπρήσας *having set it (the gunpowder) alight*.
10. ἀφ' οὗ (sc. χρόνου) *from the time when*.
11. Two reasons are given for the failure (i.) διὰ τήν τε ἀξυνεσίαν, and (ii.) ὅτι οὐκ ἐνόμιζον..., *owing to the folly of Hypsilantes and because the inhabitants did not think*, etc. It is very common in Greek to express two parallel ideas by two different syntactical constructions. Cf. [REF], where a noun and a rel. clause are parallel; and [REF], χαλεπῶς καὶ ἐν ὑετῷ where an adverb and a prepositional phrase are parallel.

1. πρὶν... ἐλθεῖν *before affairs in Roumainia came*.
2. παρασκευάζονται... *get ready to meet the crisis*.
3. The Middle Voice has a reflexive meaning, implying that the agent is working for or upon himself; in most cases English does not admit of this shade of meaning, and the Mid. is translated as if it was an active or neuter verb: e.g., βλύλονται *they wish* [REF], μάχεσθαι *to fight* [REF]. In some cases, however, the reflexive force is retained, παρασκευάζονται *they make themselves ready*; ἀμύνονται *they ward of from themselves*, i.e., *they defend themselves* [REF].
4. Ὑψ. στρατηγοῦντος *under command of Hypsilantes*. The Gen. case is used Absolutely in Greek, like Lat. Abl. Abs.
5. τὰ ὄντα *the things that are*, i.e., *the truth*.
6. The Greeks were encouraged by several monks and hermits who issued from their cells and wrought on the superstition of the peasantry by visions and prophecies.

Cf. [REF].
8. ὑπρχε *their numbers were not sufficient*. Cf. [REFn].
9.  See [REFn].
10. Καλαμάταν... ἐπολιόρκουν lit. *they besieged a place* (χωρίον τι) *Kalamata, as to its name*. Καλαμάταν is in apposition to χωρίον, ὄνομά is Acc. of Respect.

[REF] εὐχὰς ποιοῦνται = εὔχονται; [REF] λείαν ἐποιοῦντο = ελῄζοντο; [REF] φυγὴν ἐποιοῦντο = ἔφευγον, and other instances in Vocab. s.u. ποεῖν. The Passive is formed by γίγνεσθαι, e.g., ἀρχὴν ποιοῦνται τοῦ πολέμου *they begin the war*, ἀρχὴ τοῦ πολέμου γίγνεται *the war is begun*. Cf. [REF].

Twenty-four priests officiated and five thousand armed men stood round. Never was a solemn service of the Orthodox Church celebrated with greater fervour, never did hearts overflow with sincerer devotion to Heaven, nor with warmer gratitude to their church and their God. Patriotic tears poured down the cheeks of rude warriors, and ruthless brigands sobbed like children. All present felt that the event formed an era in the history of their nation." -FINLAY.
15. ὡς αἰτίους ὄντας *as being the authors*.
16. κατά *in accordance with*.

### Section 17.

1. διὰ τὸ... ἔχειν *owing to his regarding all alike with suspicion*. The Article with the Infin. forms a noun-equivalent. It can be used in any case (Dat. [REF]; Nom. [REF]) and is especially common after prepositions. The Infin. may have a subject, or object (as πάντας), and may be qualified by any adverbs (as ὁμοίως) or adverb-equivalents (as ἐν ὑποψίᾳ), just as is the case with any other use of the Infin.

### Section 18.

γλυκύς, [REFs]. πολύς, [REFs].

1. The feelings with which the Jews and Greeks regarded one another may be illustrated by this extract from Gordon: "A band of Jews attended the Pasha's camp voluntarily in the capacity of executioners, allured merely by the pleasure of butchering with clubs the Greek prisoners. One of these execrable savages afterwards boasted that in a single day he had with his own hands slaughtered sixty-four victims."
2. Greek priests wear beards, while other Greeks do not, hence it was easy to recognise the body.
3. ὥσπερ θείᾳ τύχῃ *providentially*.

6. ὅσα... ἡμαρτήκασι *the crimes of the Turks*; so ὅσα πεπόνθαμεν *our sufferings*.
7. πάντων ὧν ἐπεπόνθεσαν *for all they had suffered*. ὧν is attracted into the case of its Antecedent πάντων; this attraction occurs when the Relative Pron. would naturally be in the Acc. and its Antecedent is in the Gen. or Dat.
8. ᾐσθάνοντο... ὄντας. Cf. [REFn].


### Section 20.

Fut. Mid. of λύειν, Ind. λύσομαι, Inf. λύσεσθαι, Part. λυσόμενος, [REFs]; of εἶναι, Ind. ἔσομαι, Inf. ἔσεσθαι, Part. ἐσόμενος, [REFs]. ναῦς [REFs]; νοῦς [REFs].

Ind. ἐπιμελησόμενοι is in the Nom. by sense-construction, ἄριστον εφαίνετο... πλεῖν being equivalent to *they determined to sail*.
7. ἐφαίνοντο παρασκευαζόμενοι *were clearly making ready*; φαίνομαι εἶναι *I appear to be*; φαίνομαι ὢν *I clearly am*.


### Section 21.

χείρ [REFs]. ἀργυροῦς, [REFs].

1. The Turkish guns had a longer range than those of the Greeks, which made the latter unwilling to approach the man-of-war. On the other hand the Turkish gunners were so erratic that Lord Byron remarked on one occasion that they would be more formidable if they did not take aim.

3. εγέμισαν κληματίδων *they filled with brushwood*.

1. τούτων. Introd. Note A. (ii.).
2. Demetrius Hypsilantes is thus described by Gordon: "Nature had favoured him more in mind than in his corporeal frame, for his diminutive stature, bald head, awkward carriage, and indistinct utterance, were ill-calculated to win the opinions of those who beheld him. On the other hand it was difficult to know without esteeming him, for even his enemies were forced to confess, that to ardent patriotism he united courage, integrity and humanity, disregarded the allurements of pleasure, and had much goodness of heart, with a steadiness of purpose which at times bordered upon obstinacy."
"Colokotrones, like his father, had been a clepht. Tall and athletic, with a profusion of black hair and expressive features, alternately lighted up with boisterous gaiety, or darkened by bursts of passion : among the soldiers he seemed born to command, having just the manners and bearing calculated to gain their confidence."
3. ὧν. Cf. [REFn].
4. τῶν παρόδων... ἐσκομισθήσεται *to keep watch on the passes to prevent supplies being sent in*. Cf. [REFn].

Pass. and Mid. Perf. Ind. of λύειν, λέλυμαι, Plup. ἐλελύμην, Ιnf. λελύσθαι, Part, λελυμένος, [REFs].

1. ἐν τῷ Νεοκάστρῳ. Navarino had capitulated on 19th Aug. and a dispute arose about searching the Turkish women for jewels which they were supposed to have concealed. "Women wounded with musket balls and sabre cuts rushed to the sea seeking to escape and were deliberately shot. Greeks seized infants from their mothers' breasts and dashed them against the rocks. Children, three and four years old, were hurled living into the sea and left to drown. When the massacre was ended, the dead bodies washed ashore or piled on the beach threatened to cause a pestilence. Phrantzes (a Greek priest) who records these atrocities of his countrymen with shame and indignation, himself hired men to burn the bodies of the victims with the wrecks of some vessels in the harbour." FINLAY.
2. Colokotrones records in his Memoirs that when he rode into the town his horse "from the walls to the palace never touched the earth,” owing to the accumulation of dead bodies.
3. τοὺς ἔνδον ἀποκτείνοντες ἐπέπαυντο, lit. *murdering the inhabitants they had then desisted*.

"After the Greeks had been in possession of the city for fortyeight hours, they deliberately collected together about 2,000 persons of every age and sex, but principally women and children, and led them to a ravine in the nearest mountain, where they murdered every soul. . . Some prisoners were spared for a short time to bury the bodies of their slaughtered countrymen, which were putrefying by thousands in almost every house and garden. Even this precaution was too long neglected. The air was already tainted with a deadly miasma and a terrible epidemic soon broke out among the Greeks." FINLAY.

2. ὅπως... ἐσαγάγωσιν *in order to introduce*; ὅπως (or ἵνα) *in order that* with the Subj. expresses purpose. The Aor. in the Subj. Optat. and Imperat. moods is not a past tense: the difference between it and the present is not a difference in *time* but in *kind* of action; the present regards the action as *continuing*, the Aorist regards it simply as *occurring*. Cf. [REF].
3. τῶν νήσων κρατηθεισῶν, Gen. Abs. expressing a condition, *if the islands were conquered*.
4. ἐπικινδυνοτάτην εἶχον. See [REFn].

"Celebrated for its fertility and the enchanting aspect of its gardens, Chios carried on a brisk trade in silk and fruit; from thence Constantinople was supplied with oranges, lemons and citrons; but the most valuable production of the country is gum mastic, a substance highly valued by Eastern ladies, who amuse their indolence by chewing it, deriving from that practice as much gratification as their male relations enjoy by inhaling the fumes of tobacco." GORDON.
8. φοβούμενοι μὴ πάθωσι *fearing that they would suffer*. The object clauses after words of fearing are introduced by μή *lest*, followed by the subj.
9.  Antonius Bournia had previously served in the French army.
10. ἐποτρύνωσι. See [REFn].
11. εἴτε μετέχωσι *whether they should take part in the war*. The subj. is used in Deliberative Questions, as in Latin.

### Section 27.

Act. Optat. Pres. of λύειν, λύοιμι, [REFs]; Str. Aor. of πάσχειν, πάθοιμι. Numerals, [REFs]. εἰς, δύο, τρεῖς, τέσσαρες, [REFs].

1. οὕτως ἔπραξαν *fared thus*. πράσσειν, like "do" in English, with adv. means *to fare*.
2. The Albanian Christians, who lived at Souli, had fought on the side of Ali Pasha of Janina; when Ali was killed (Feb., 1822), they had continued the war with some success under Marcus Botzares, but were now being besieged in the Castle of Kiapha, which is the Acropolis of Souli.
3. παρέχοι. After an historic tense (ἐβούλετο) the Optative may be used (instead of the Subj.) in final clauses, and with verbs of fearing [REF].
4. γνώμῃ... *inferior to no one in judgment*; οὐδενός is Gen. of Compar. See [REFn].

When two Rel. clauses, referring to the same antecedent (here λόφον), stand side by side, and the second Relative would be in a different case from the first (here first Rel. is ὃν and second would be ὃς), the second Rel. is either omitted (as here), or replaced by a Personal Pronoun. Cf. St. Matt. iii. 12, *whose fan is in his hand, and he* (not *who*) *will throughly purge his floor*.
5. ὡς σωτηρίας... *as each group had hope of safety*.
6. τοῖς δὲ λοιποῖς *with the rest*. Cf. [REFn].
7. οὐδεμιᾶς ἐλάσσων *less than none*, i.e., *worse than any of the calamities in the war*.
8. The remnant of the Philhellenes was disbanded shortly afterwards. The following incident is related by Gordon: "At noon on 16th July, as Mavrocordato sat at dinner with his suite at Langada, one of the Greek commanders, examining the shoulder-blade of a sheep according to a method of divination practised in the East, declared that their friends had suffered a bloody defeat; this caused some mirth at the seer's expense, until a horseman, while they were still at table, brought news of the battle of Peta". Two days after the battle Gogos went over to the enemy. Some of the Souliotes continued to fight on the Greek side under M. Botzares. See Sect. 35.
9. Corcyra (Corfu) was neutral territory, being under the control of an English High Commissioner.


### Section 29.

3. ὅπερ *id quod*.

1. μαθόντων *let them learn*. The 3rd Pers. Plur. of Imperatives is the same in form as the Gen. Plur. of the Participle.
2. ἔχονται καὶ αἱ νῆσοι *the islands too are in their hands*; the Present is used graphically for the Future.
3. τίνα ἐλπίδα ἔχοντες... *with what hope or with what purpose*? The interrogative τίς; *who*? is declined like the indefinite τις *any one*, but accented differently, [REFs].
4. πῶς οὐ βλάβη (ἐστί); *how is it not a loss*? i.e., *surely it is injurious*.
5. νομίσῃ μηδείς *let no one suppose*. Prohibitions are expressed by μή (or compounds μηδείς, μηκέτι, κ.τ.λ.) with (i.) the Aor. Subj. or (ii.) the Pres. Imperat. [REF].
6. φυλάσσομεν *let us guard*. The Subj. supplies the missing 1st Pers. Plur. of the Imperat. as in Latin.
7. αναχωροῦσιν, Participle, *when they retreat*.
8. πάντων μάλιστα *most of all*.
9. πάσχειν = βλάπτεσθαι.
10. μηκέτι... ἔστε *do not be alarmed any longer*, [REFn].
11. πρὸς ὑμῶν *in your favour*.

1. τὰ σφέτερα αὐτῶν = *sua*, *their own property*. σφέτερος is used (i.) as a Direct Reflexive, referring to the subject of the verb in its own clause, or (ii.) as an Indirect Reflexive, used in a Subordinate clause, and referring to the Subject of the main verb. If αὐτῶν is added, it is a Direct Reflexive only.
2. τοὺς ἑαυτοῦ *his own men*.
3. ταύτῃ *there*.
4. σφᾶς is an Indirect Reflexive, used in a Subordinate clause and referring to the Subject of the main verb.
5. οὐ πολὺς... *there was not much time and Colokotrones arrived*, i.e., *it was not long before C. arrived*.
6. τολμηρότεροι ἑαυτῶν γενόμενοι *becoming braver than themselves*; a common way in Greek of expressing *their courage increased*.
7. οἱ ἐκ τῶν μετεώρων, we should say *those on the hills*; Greek often accommodates the prepos. to the sense of motion expressed in the verb the men came down *from* the hills.
8. ἀσφάλεια τῆς ἐξόδου... *that Hypsilantes and his men might come away in safety*.
9. On the second occasion, one of the Greeks happened to be asleep when his companions evacuated the fort, and was accidentally left behind. Awakened by the noise of the Turks rushing in to plunder, he seized a large copper cauldron, and, putting it over his head to conceal his features, walked boldly out. The Turks, thinking he was one of themselves carrying off loot, let him pass with a few jokes at his ridiculous appearance. TRICOUPI.


### Section 32.

doris, [REFs]. Wk. Aor. Subj. of λύειν, Pass. λυθῶ, Mid. λύσωμαι, [REFs].

1. προσεδέχοντο should be προσδεχόμενοι, corresponding with φυλάσσοντες, but such slight irregularities are very common. Cf. ἔμελλε in [REF].
2. The Turkish fleet which should have brought supplies sailed away to Patras owing to the Admiral's jealousy of Dramali.
3. τὰ τῶν πολεμίων... *seeing the affairs of the enemy in what state they are*, i.e., *seeing in what state the enemy are*. For the order of words, by which τὰ τῶν πολεμίων is made the Object of ἰδόντες instead of being placed in the dependent clause as Subject, compare St. Mark i. 24, *I know thee who thou art*. ὅστις introduces an Indirect Question ; the Direct Question was ἐν τίνι ἐστὶ τὰ τῶν πολεμίων; *in what state are the enemy's affairs*? Greek retains the original tense (ἐστί), just as it does in ὅτι clauses. See [REFn].
4. Dramali's difficulties were much increased owing to the season being singularly dry. Disease broke out among his men, who were living mainly on green grapes and unripe melons.
5. οἵτινες... ποιήσονται *to make an ambuscade*: ὅστις with Fut. Indic. expresses *purpose*.
6. τὰ χαλεπώτατα... *the most difficult points in the pass*.
7.  ποιήσωνται... κρατήσειαν, after an historic tense, ὅπως may take the Subj. ([REFn].) or the Optat. ([REFn].); occasionally, as here, both are used: there is no difference in meaning.
8. ἦν *it was possible*.
9. ὅποι τράπωνται *where to turn*; Delib. Subj., see [REFn]
10. καί... καί... *both... and*....


### Section 33.

1. ἰδὼν... πράγματα *seeing the state of affairs*. Cf. [REFn].
2. τοὐναντίον... *the opposite way to that which the enemy were guarding*.
3. οἵτινες *since they*; ὅστις, besides being an Indirect Interrogative Pronoun, is used (i.) to express *cause*, as here; (ii.) with Fut. Ind. to express *purpose*, [REFn].; and (iii.) as an Indefinite Rel. Pron. meaning *whoever*, [REF].
4. τὸ πολύ = οἱ πολλοί *the majority*.
5. The state of these fugitives is thus described by Gordon: "The famishing soldiers, after eating all their horses, existed on the flesh of their dead comrades, and even fought over their graves".


### Section 34.

Pass. and Mid. Optat. Pres. of λύειν, λυοίμην, [REFs]; of ποιεῖν, ποιοίμην, [REFs]; Str. Aor. Mid. of γίγνεσθαι, γενοίμην.

1. These Albanians were Christians, serving as mercenaries to the Turks. They spoke the same dialect and wore the same dress as M. Botzares and his Souliotes.
2. For M. Botzares, see [REFn].
3. πεῖραν ποιεῖσθαι, see [REFn].
4. ἂν ἐπιφέροιντο *they would attack*; ἂν gives to the Optative a Potential sense, expressed in English by *would*, *might* or *could*.
5. ὅποι τράποιντο *where to turn*; after an historic tense, the Optat. may be substituted for the Delib. Subj. in Indirect Questions. The original question was ποῖ τραποώμεθα; *where are we to turn*? Cf. [REF].


### Section 35.

Pass. and Mid. Imperat. Pres. of λύειν, λύου; Wk. Aor. Mid. λῦσαι; Wk. Aor. Pass. λύθητι, [REFs]; Str. Aor. Mid. of γίγνεσθαι, γένου ; Pres. of ποιεῖν, ποιοῦ, [REFs].

1. αὐτοῦ *on the spot*.
2. οἵτινες *since they*. Cf. [REFn].
3. μὴ ἐκπλαγῆτε *do not be alarmed*. See [REFn].
4. πλήθει ελάσσους *inferior in numbers*.
5. μὴ ἀνδρείοις οὖσι *if we are not brave*; the Neg. is μή (not οὐ), because the Participle expresses a condition.
6. πρὸς ἡμῶν *on our side*. Cf. [REF].
7. περὶ πλείστου ποιεῖσθε, lit. *regard above very much*, i.e., *regard as of the greatest importance*.


### Section 36.

Optat. Pres. of εἶναι, εἴην, [REFs]; Optat. Wk. Aor. Ρass. of λύειν, λυθείην, Μid. λυσαίμην, Fut. λυσοίμην, [REFs].

1. εἰ βουλομένῳ μοί ἐστι, lit. *whether it is to me being willing*, i.e., *whether I am willing*; compare Lat. *quibus bellum volentibus erat*.
2. δέχεσθαι τῇ πόλει *admit into the city*; the Dat. Tπόλειóλe is Instrumental, literally, *receive with the city*; the Instrum. Abl. in Lat. is used similarly with *recipere*.
3. ἄσμενος ἂν δεξαίμην *I would gladly admit him*: we translate the predicated Adjective ἄσμενος by an Adverb. Cf. Lat. *primus hoc feci*, *I did it first*, and τελευταῖος, [REF].
4. πρός *in answer to*.
5. περὶ τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν *with regard to the Greek War*; τὰ Ἑλληνικά is the subject of μέλλει. See [REFn].
6. καταφαίνοιντο *are in sight*. In a clause introduced by ὅτι (*that*), the Optat. may be substituted for the original Indicative, if the tense of the main verb is historic (here ἦλθε). Notice that though the *mood* is altered, the tense remains the same; the original message was οἱ Τοῦρκοι καταφαίνονται. Cf. [REF]n.
7. εἰ ἐλπίζοιεν *whether they hoped*; ἐλπίζοιεν in the original question was ἐλπίζουσι.
8. ες τὰ μάλιστα *in the highest degree*.
9. εἶμεν... φοβοίμεθα... εἴη... ἀναγκασθεῖμεν... ἔχοι. What were these words in the original statement?
10. βουλόμενος *if you are willing*.
11. οὐκ ἴδιον... *the lead he had was not his own*.Cf. [REFn].
12. βουλεύσοιτο, he actually said βουλεύσομαι *I'll think about it*.
13. ὅτι sometimes introduces the original words, and is represented in English by inverted commas.
14. τοῦ οἴνου, Partitive Gen. *some wine*.
15. ξυνενέγκοι... *may everything turn out as we wish*. The Optat. by itself in a Principal Sentence expresses a wish; hence its name.
16. The Turks subsequently advanced to Anatolicon, a small town situated in the lagoons, about five miles west of Messalonghi. The inhabitants had been accustomed to get their supplies of drinkingwater from the mainland, as there were no springs on the island of this the Turks were aware, and therefore expected to force it to surrender quickly. A Turkish shell, however, happened to fall on the Church of St. Michael, and, breaking through the pavement, disclosed a spring, which not only supplied sufficient water, but encouraged the people to think that a miracle had been performed on their behalf. After about a month the Turks abandoned the siege.


## PART IV.

### Section 37.

τιμᾶν, [REFs].

1. παρὰ γνώμην *contrary to expectation*.
2. ὅπερ... *which no one would have believed, if he had been told, before it happened*. ἄν is used with the Past Tenses of the Indic. in a Potential sense, expressing might have, would have, could have. Cf. [REFn].
3. τὰ μέν... τὰ δὲ *partly... partly*, or *sometimes... at other times*.
4. As an instance of Byron's energy, the following story may be quoted. When he was at Cephalonia, a number of workmen engaged in excavating were buried by the fall of a mass of earth. Byron heard of the accident while at dinner, and rushing to the place seized a spade and by his example stimulated the panic-stricken onlookers to set to work. The result was that all the workmen were rescued.
5. The Ionian islands, being under the protection of England, were the chief place of refuge for those Greeks who had been driven from their homes by the Turks. Cf. [REFn].
6. ἃς ἂν ναῦς *whatever ships they had*. ἄν, joined to Rel. pronouns or conjunctions, and followed by the Subjunctive, gives an Indefinite Sense, expressed in English by *ever*.
7. On 30th December Byron and Count Gamba (an Italian) with their baggage and a large sum of money set sail in separate ships. Byron's ship fell in with a Turkish frigate, but succeeded in getting away to some rocky islands called Scrofes, where Byron concealed himself in a cave. Gamba and his ship were captured, but by a curious coincidence the captain of the Turkish frigate had once been saved from death by the Greek skipper, and, in gratitude for this, he pretended that he saw nothing suspicious about the vessel, and let it continue its voyage.


### Section 38.

ζῆν, χρῆσθαι, [REFs]. Contracted Futures, [REFs].

1. See [REF].
2. οὔτε ὅθεν... κομιοῦνται *nor having whence they shall get rations*, i.e., *not being able to get rations*.
3. ἔστιν ὅτε *sometimes*. Cf. [REF]. ἔστιν ᾗ *in some places*.
4. The disorder culminated in the following incident: A Souliote, noted for his bravery, came to the armoury with a young son of M. Botzares, and, having no written permission to enter, was stopped by the sentry. He persisted in going in, and the officer on guard ordered him to be arrested; a quarrel ensued, and the Souliote, having received a blow, killed the officer on the spot. In an instant alarm pervaded the town: the Souliotes rose to arms, threatening to storm the armoury and even Byron's house, if their countryman, who had been apprehended, was not set at liberty. The riot was at length appeased, but Byron declared that he would return to the Ionian islands if the Souliotes did not leave Messalonghi. GORDON.
5. ἔπροσσεν ὅπως... *took steps to make the place secure*. Verbs of Effort take ὅπως with Fut. Indic. Cf. [REFn].
6. οὐχ ἕξουσιν ὅπως *will not be able to*. Cf. [REFn].
7. εἶς is used emphatically with Superlatives, *this man of all others*, like Lat. *unus*.
8. τῶν καθ' ἑαυτόν *of his contemporaries*.
9. On 9th April Byron went out to ride near the town and was overtaken by a heavy shower, and returned home in a boat. Shortly afterwards he complained of fever: the doctors prescribed bleeding, but he refused, saying, “I will drink all your medicines, but not one drop of my blood will I shed. All of it shall be shed on the field of battle." Delirium came on, then stupor, and at six o'clock in the afternoon of Easter Monday (19th April) at the instant of an awful thunderstorm Byron expired.
His coffin was laid by the side of the grave of M. Botzares, but as he expressed a wish to be buried in the tomb of his ancestors (at Hucknall Torkard, near Nottingham), the body was removed to England, and his heart interred at Messalonghi.

### Section 39.

δηλοῦν, [REFs].

1. τὰ ἑαυτῶν... *regarding only their own interests*.
2. τοῖς χήμασι *from lack of money*. Instrum. Dat.
3. ὅσα ἂν δέῃ *whatever was necessary*. See [REFn].
4. A committee was formed in London, including Jeremy Bentham, Joseph Hume and T. Gordon (the historian of the war), and a loan amounting to £300,000 was raised. The security was very bad, and, in fact, the interest was never paid, but by a fortunate coincidence for Greek liberty, a mania for every kind of wild speculation had just then seized English capitalists.
5. A talent was a sum of money worth 6,000 drachmæ or £210 in English money. A drachma = a franc.
6. ὅσα λάβοιεν *whatever money they got*; after an historic tense (ἐδαπάντων), the Rel. followed by the Optat. is used in an Indefinite Sense. After a Primary tense, this would be ὅσα ἂν λάβωσι. Cf. [REF].
7. εκ τοῦ τοιούτου, *by such conduct*.
8. "Every man of consideration in his own imagination wanted to place himself at the head of a band of armed men, and hundreds of civilians paraded the streets of Nauplia with trains of kilted followers, like Scottish chieftains. Phanariots and doctors of medicine, who in the month of April were clad in ragged coats, and who lived on scanty rations, threw off that patriotic chrysalis before summer was past, and emerged in all the splendour of brigand life, refulgent with brilliant but unused arms, fluttering about in rich Albanian habiliments, and followed by diminutive pipe-bearers and tall henchmen. FINLAY.


### Section 40.

ἱστάναι, Act. Voice, [REFs].

3. εὕρηται Delib. Subj.; εὕποιτο might have been used. See [REFn].
4. "Mehemet-Ali was a determined reformer, although his reforms, like those of all Eastern despots, were directed solely to two points: augmenting his revenue, and forming a disciplined standing army. The first he brought about by a most horrible system of oppression and monopoly, turning the cultivators into bondsmen and making himself the only merchant and landowner in the country; the second he effected by establishing an arbitrary conscription among the Arab villagers, and purchasing the services of European instructors." GORDON.
5. τὰ τῆς χώρας... ἐς τὸ ἐπιτήδειον *controlling the organisation of the country, he arranged matters to his own advantage*.
6. ὅθεv *by which course*.
7. ὅταν... ᾗ *whenever occasion should arise*; Temporal Conjunctions compounded with ἄν (ὅταν, ὁπόταν, ἐπειδάν), followed by the Subj. have an Indefinite sense, expressed in English by *ever*. This ever has one of two meanings:
   1. It refers to *one* occasion in the unknown future, e.g., whenever (= at any time when) I die, I shall be cremated.
   2. It refers to an unknown number of occasions, e.g., whenever (= at every time when) I am hungry, I eat.
   ὅταν is used in sense (i.); ὁπόταν in sense (ii.); ἐπειδάν in either sense. See [REF].
8. επειδὴ ὑπέστη *since he had undertaken the expedition*.
9. ὁπότε... ἔλθοιεν *whenever they came to close quarters*; after an historic tense, ὅτε, ὁπότε, and ἐπειδή, followed by the Optat. are used in the same Indefinite sense, as ὅταν, ὁπόταν, and ἐπειδάν, with the Subj. See [REFn]. Compare the use of the Relative, [REFn].
10. δέov, Acc. Abs. See [REFn].


### Section 41. ἱστάναι Mid. and Pass., [REFs]. δύναμαι I am able, ἐπίσταμαι I know, are conjugated like ἵσταμαι, but see [REFs].

1. ἕως ἄν... πειρῶνται *until they should try*; ἕως ἄν *so long as* or *until*, μέχρι ἄν (or μέχρι οὗ ἄν) *until*, followed by the Subj., have an Indefinite sense, not expressed in English. They refer:
   1. to one occasion in the unknown future, e.g., we will work, till we have finished.
   2. to an unknown period of time, e.g., while there is life, there is hope.
   After an historic tense, the same Indefinite sense is expressed by ἕως, μέχρι (or μέχρι οὗ), followed by the Optat. Compare [REFn], [REFn]
2. τοῖς ἐπιχειρήμασιν, Instrum. Dat. *they were not successful in* (lit. *by*) *their efforts*.
3. οὐκ ἔχοντες... *not having a point at which they should make a stand*, i.e., *a rallying point*.
4. ἕως ἀναγκασθεῖν. See [REFn].
5. At four o'clock in the afternoon, a soldier, bearing a lighted match, was seen to leave the monastery and run towards the entrance of a great subterraneous magazine, situated outside-he fell, pierced with balls, and five of his companions, following his example, one after the other, shared his fate. Unable to execute their first project, the Greeks resolved to inflame the powder they had within the monastery. They ceased their fire, and the Turks darting on, sword in hand, scaled the walls on every side; when suddenly the Hellenic flag was lowered, a white banner, inscribed with the words 'Liberty or Death,' waved in the air, a single gun gave the signal, and a tremendous explosion, shaking the island and felt far out at sea, buried in the ruins of St. Nicholas thousands of the conquerors and the conquered!" Gordon.


### Section 42. δεικνύναι, [REFs].

1.  A desultory siege of Patras continued throughout the war.
1. τὰ περί... *the management of the loan was not in accordance with their views*.
2. πρίν... καταλύσειαν *until they should overthrow the existing democracy*. The Greeks had elected representatives, but great confusion had arisen owing to party quarrels. If the main verb is negatived, and οὐπρίν *not before* means *not until*, πρίν takes the same construction as μέχρι and ἕως, [REFn]. When πρίν means *before*, it takes the Infin.
3. οὐ πρότερον πρίν... *not until*; the Indic. is used referring to a Definite time, as is the case with all temporal conjunctions.
4. διὰ τόν τε θάνατον... καὶ ὅτι... (a) *owing to his son's death, and* (b) *because the conspirators were unsuccessful*. Cf. [REFn].
5. καθίστατο τοῖς ἐν τοῖς ἀγροῖς *befell the rural population*.

3. τοιαύτης i.e., against disciplined troops.
4. Sphakteria is famous as the scene of the Spartan surrender in B.C. 425.
5. κατὰ τὸν λιμένα *on the harbour side*.
6. Mavrocordato, being a slow runner, would have been taken prisoner had not two soldiers helped him along, and got him on board a vessel from Hydra, named the Mars. For six hours he sat in the cabin, holding a pistol which might save him the ignominy of being sent in chains to Constantinople; he uttered no word except now and then a brief sentence expressive of the vanity of ambition, and a resolution, if he survived, to retire into private life. Meanwhile the Mars fought her way out of the harbour; the Turkish ships did not dare to approach too near, as the Greek captain could be seen standing with a lighted torch ready to blow up the ship, if any attempt was made to board her. FINLAY.


### Section 44. ἰέναι (all), [REFs].

1. εφ' ᾧτε is used with the Fut. Indic. to express *on condition that*. The Pres. Ind. of ἰέναι (and its compounds) has a future meaning: the Past Imperfect and the other moods supply the missing forms of ἔρχομαι.
2. ὅποι ἂν βούλωνται *whithersoever they wished* (lit. *shall wish*).
3. εἰ ἐπίοιεν... *if ever the enemy attacked*; after an historic tense, εἰ with the Optat. expresses *if ever*. Cf. [REFn]. When the main verb is primary, the same meaning is expressed by ἤν (= εἰ ἄν), followed by the Subj. Cf. [REF] and [REFn].
4. παρὰ λόγον *contrary to expectation*.
5. τήν τε πόλιν... *they burnt* (a) *the town, and* (b) *whatever they could not carry away*. See [REFn].
6. ἤν πως *if perchance*, i.e., *in hopes that*; after an historic tense, this might be εἴ πως with Optat. Cf. [REF].
7. When Colokotrones was imprisoned (see [REF]), he exclaimed, "I have twice saved my country, and shall be called upon to save it a third time". GORDON.
8. The Greeks were so demoralised that Colokotrones had great difficulty in keeping his men together. On one occasion his scouts rushed in crying, "Back, back, there are horsemen in the olive-yard". Presently, however, the horsemen were transformed into a flock of crows and flew away. TRICOUPI.
9. During this expedition Ibrahim advanced nearly as far as Argos. From a lofty point in the road he caught a view of Hydra, and, stretching out his hand, exclaimed, “Ah, little England, how long wilt thou escape me?" GORDON.


### Section 45. διδόναι, Act. Voice, [REFs].

1. When the Turks retired from Messalonghi (Section 36), they buried their guns, and erected tombstones over them: the Greeks were deceived by this stratagem, and proudly pointed to the inscriptions which recorded the fate of their enemies. When Kiutayhé (or Reschid Pasha, as he was generally called) began the second siege, he dug up the guns and used them against the Greeks.
2. εἰ μή *except*.
3. εἰ... ἐγένετο *if this had not been done, they would have been compelled*. Unfulfilled Past Condition.
4. ὁπότε. Cf. [REFn].

10. τὸ ἔργον, i.e., the making of the mound; προσέχουσι is Dat. Plur. of Partic.

1. καλῶς ἔπραξαν. Cf. [REFn].
2. ἕως ἄν. Cf. [REFn].
3. καθ' ἡμέραν... προϊοῦσαν *as each day came on*.
4. ἀσθενέστεροι ἢ ὥστε *too weak to*. Cf. [REFn].
5. "At Messalonghi, when they issued forth amid the drizzle of the night, feeling their desolation and their doom, they said to one another, 'The Almighty Himself weeps for us to-night!' But they went on, sword in hand, to fall for their country, greeting her with the gladsome cry, 'Arise, thou dearest mother!'" GENNADIUS.
6. κραυγῇ... *by some cry of confusion* (lit. *of those confused*). "Almost at the moment when the garrison rushed on the Turks, that portion of the Messalonghiots which was then on the bridges raised a cry of 'Back, back'. Great part of the Messalonghiots stopt, fell back, and returned into the town with the military escort, which ought to have formed the rear-guard of the sortie. The origin of this ill-timed cry, which weakened the force of the sortie and added to the victims in the place, has excited much unnecessary speculation. It  evidently arose among those who were in danger of being forced into the ditch. Their cry was repeated so loudly that it created a panic." FINLAY.
7. ὅσοις ἐντύχοιεν. Cf. [REFn].
8. εἴ πως. Cf. [REF].
9. ἂν ἐγένετο. Cf. [REFn]. The deserter was a Bulgarian mercenary.
