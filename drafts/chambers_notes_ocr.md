## INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO SECTIONS 1 AND 2 
During the first few lessons, while the Greek Alphabet [REF] and the portions of Grammar given below are being learnt, it is intended that these two sections should be used for practice in reading, and should be translated by instalments to the class.

Nouns should be declined *viva voce*, and also on paper, with or without an adjective and the article, *e.g.*, ἡ μικρά γῆ, ἡ χαλεπὴ ὁδός, στενός Ἰσθμός. Similarly the Pres. Ind. of verbs should be conjugated, *e.g.*, ἔχειν.

Attention should be drawn to cognate words in English and Latin (*e.g.*, κόλπ-ος = *gulf*, μέσος = *medius*), and also to the close connection between the terminations of 1st and 2nd Declen. nouns in Latin and Greek.

As occasion arises, emphasis should be laid on (A) the connection between sentences, and (B) the uses of the Article. The rules are collected here for convenience, but, of course, only one or two points will be dealt with in any one lesson.

### A. 
(i.) Every sentence is connected with its predecessor by a conjunction or connecting particle; of these the commonest are καί *and* [REF]; δέ *but* , unemphatic [REF]; γάρ *for* [REF]; ἀλλά *but*, emphatic [REF]; οὖν *therefore* [REF]; τε *and* [REF]; μέντοι *however* [REF]; ἔπειτα *then* [REF]. Notice that δέ, γάρ, οὖν, τε, μέντοι, do not come first word in the sentence.

(ii.) There is one exception to the above rule. When the demonstrative pronoun οὗτος *this*, or its derivatives οὕτω *thus*, τοιοῦτος *οf such a kind*, sum up what has already been stated, no conjunction is required [REF]; similarly, when the demonstrative pronoun ὅδε *this*, or its derivatives, ὧδε *thus*, τοιόσδε *of such a character*, look forward to what is coming, no conjunction is required with the following sentence [REF].

(iii.) When two words or groups of words are parallel, they may be joined by τε ... καί ... [REF] or καί ... καί ... [REF], *both ... and ...*; in English we seldom use the word *both*, and therefore leave τε untranslated; this is necessarily the case when τε ... καί ... καί ... occurs [REF].

(iv.) When two clauses or sentences are contrasted, μέν ... δέ ..., *on the one hand ... but on the other ...*, are used. μέν (just like τε *both*) looks forward to something which is coming, but δέ connects with what has gone before, and means BUT *on the other hand*, not simply *on the other hand*. The contrast between the μέν clause and the δέ clause, is often so slight that we do not translate μέν at all, and translate δέ by *but*, or even by *and* [REF].
 
πρῶτον μέν *firstly*, is habitually answered by ἔπειτα *secondly*, not by ἔπειτα δέ, as we should expect [REF].

### B. The uses of the Article. 
(See also headings to Ex. 1-6.)

(i.) It is habitually used with the names of countries, islands and towns, ἡ Ἑλλάς *Greece* [REF]; ἡ Εὔβοια *Euboea* [REF]; αἱ Ἀθῆναι *Athens*; and with Proper Nouns, if the person is well known or has previously been mentioned, ὁ Πέλοψ *Pelops* [REF].

(ii.) It is used as an unemphatic possessive pronoun, διὰ τὸν πλοῦτον *on account of his wealth* [REF]; τὰς πηγὰς ἔχει *has its springs* [REF].

(iii.) It is placed, as in English, before an attributive adjective, or may be repeated with the adjective after the noun, ὁ Κορίνθιος κόλπος *the Corinthian gulf* [REF]; ἐς τὸν κόλπον τὸν Ἰόνιον *into the Ionian gulf* [REF].

(iv.) Instead of an adjective, the attribute may be a prepositional phrase, an adverb, or a genitive case, ἡ πρὸς Βορέαν μοῖρα lit. *the towards-north part*, i.e., *the northern part* [REF]; οἱ γεωργοὶ οἱ ἐν τῇ μεσογείᾳ *the farmers in the interior* [REF]; οἱ νῦν ἐπιχώριοι lit. *the now inhabitants*, i.e., *the present inhabitants* [REF]; ὁ Θουκυδίδης ὁ Ὀλόρου *Thucydides the (son) of Olorus* [REF].

(v.) It is used with abstract nouns, ἡ ἐπιμειξία *communication* [REF]; ὁ κίνδυνος *danger* [REF].

(vi.) It is omitted with a predicated adjective or noun, τῶν νήσων μεγίστη ἐστὶν ἡ Εὔβοια *Euboea is the largest of the islands* [REF].

(vii.) It denotes a whole class, δύο αἰτίαι προάγουσι τοὺς ὑπηκόους ἐς τὸν πόλεμον *two causes lead subject peoples into war* [REF].

(viii.) The Article was originally a demonstrative pronoun, and can be used, if accompanied by μέν or δέ, meaning *he*, *she*, *it* and *they*. This is especially common in expressions like οἱ μέν ... οἱ δέ ... *these ... but those ...*, *some ... but others ...*, οἱ μὲν φίλοι εἰσὶ τῷ Ἑλληνικῷ δήμῳ, οἱ δὲ ξύμμαχοί εἰσι τῶν Τούρκων *some are friendly to the Greek nation, but others are the allies of the Turks* [REF]; τὰ μὲν αἰσχύνην φέρει, ἐκ δὲ τῶν δόξαν λαμβάνουσι *some deeds bring disgrace, but from others they win honour* [REF]. Notice the order when a preposition is used.

oi δέ necessarily comes first in its clause, A. (iv.): oi μέν generally comes first, but may be preceded by a word or group of words which belongs to both clauses, see [REF]. It is not necessary that, when οἱ δέ is used, oi μέν should have preceded, but oi δέ must not refer to the subject of the previous sentence, see [REF].

(ix.) The Article with an adjective, a prepositional phrase, an adverb, or a genitive case, forms a noun-equivalent, οἱ παλαιοί *the ancients* [REF]; ἡ παραθαλάσσιος *the coast* [REF]; τὸ δίκαιον *justice* [REF]; οἱ κάτω *those on the coast* [REF]; οἱ ἐν τῇ μεσογείᾳ *those in the interior* [REF]; οἱ κατ' ἤπειρον *those along the mainland* [REF]; οἱ ἐν τῇ ξυνωμοσίᾳ *the members of the conspiracy* [REF]; οἱ μετ' αὐτοῦ *his companions* [REF]; τὰ ἐν τῷ στρατοπέδῳ *the state of the camp* [REF]; τὰ περὶ τῆς ξυνωμοσίας *the facts about the conspiracy* [REF]; τὰ τῶν Τούρκων *the property of the Turks* [REF].

## Section 1. 

ἡ μάχη, ὥρα, [REF]; ὁ δοῦλος, [REF]; στενός, μικρός (Masc. and Fem.), [REF].

Pres. Ind. of εἶναι, εἰμί ; of λύειν, λύω, [REF].

1. έστι μέν, ἔχει δέ. Introd. Note A. (iv.).
2. ἡ Ἑλλάς. ίντροδ. Νote B. (i.).
3. αὐτός, -ή, -ό, in the Nom. means *self* (Lat. *ipse*), but the Oblique Cases are also used for the Personal Pronoun, *him, her, it*. αὐτῶν = *earum*.
4. ήπειρος *mainland*; thus the Western coast of Northern Greece was called Epirus in contrast with the adjacent islands.
5. ἡ πρὸς Βορέαν μοῖρα. Introd. Note B. (iv.).
6. χερσόνησος, lit. *dry-land-island*; νῆσος = *island*.
7. ἡ πρὸς μεσημβρίαν *the southern*, μοῖρα is understood in Greek, as *part* is in English.
8. οἱ μὲν παλαιοί. Introd. Note B. (ix.). μέν is answered by δέ in [REF]. 
8. Πελοπόννησον, lit. *island of Pelops*. According to tradition Pelops, the son of Tantalus, came from Lydia and became King of Pisa in Elis; see *Mythological Dictionary*.
9.  ἐκ τῆς Ἀσίας *from Asia*; prepositions meaning *from* take the Gen. in Greek, because the Gen. expresses separation, like the Latin Abl. of separation.
10. αφικόμενος *having come*; Participles are given in the Vocab. as adjectives.
11. ὡς *as*. Thucydides, the son of Olorus, was an Athenian, who wrote the history of the Peloponnesian War (B.C. 431-404).
12. ὁ Ὀλόρου. Introd. Note B. (iv.).
13. τε ... καί. Introd. Note A. (iii.).

18. The modern name of the Achelous is Aspropotamo, meaning White-river.
19. τὰς πηγάς *its springs*, *cf*. [REF] *n*.
20. τὸν Ἰόνιον. Introd. Note B. (iii.).
21. διά with Gen. means *through* (as here), or *by means of*; with Acc. it means *on account of*.
22. ἡ ἐπιμειξία *communication*. Introd. Note B. (v.).
23. τοῖς ... παραθαλασσίοις, the Article with a prepositional phrase or with an adjective is equivalent to a noun, *for those in the interior and on the coast*. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
24. μεγίστη *the largest*; the Article is omitted with a *predicated* adjective in Greek. Introd. Note B. (vi.).
25. τε ... καί ... καί. Introd. Note A. (iii.).

## Section 2. 

τὸ δῶρον, [REF] ; Neut. of στενός, μικρός, [REF]; δόξα, [REF]; ὅδε, [REF].

1. κατὰ τήν ἀρχήν *at the beginning*.
2. ὅδε this is declined like the Article with δε added; when it is used with nouns, the Article must also be used immediately before the noun; ὁ πόλεμος ὅδε or ὅδε ὁ πόλεμος *this war*. For exception, see [REF] *n*.
3. οἱ μέν ... οἱ δέ. Introd. Note B. (viii.).
4. κατὰ κώμας ἀτειχίστους *in unfortified villages*. Compound adjectives (ἀ-τείχιστος *un-walled*) have no separate form for the Fem. *Cf*. παραθαλάσσιος, πολυάνθρωπος [REF].
5. οἱ δὲ κάτω *but those on the coast*, the Article with an adverb forming the equivalent of a noun. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
6. κάτω properly *down*. The Greeks spoke of "going *down* to the coast," "*up* into the interior," and "on the *high* seas," just as we do; the coast is regarded as the lowest point.
7. τὸν πλεῖστον τοῦ βίου *the greater part of their livelihood*; the adjective is made to agree in gender with the noun in the (partitive) Genitive.
8. ἡ παραθαλάσσιος sc. γῆ. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
9. ναυτικῷ ὄχλῳ *with a crowd of sailors*; *with* and *by* are expressed in Greek by the Dative, corresponding with the Latin (instrumental) Ablative.
10. οἱ ἐν τῇ μεσογείᾳ. Introd. Note B. (iv.).
11. τούς τε ἄλλους... *to pay tithes of their produce and other taxes*; the English order is the reverse of the Greek order.
12. ὥστε with Ind. introduces a Consecutive Clause, *so that*.
13. δι' ἁρπαγῆς, see [REF] *n*.
14. ὥσπερ κλέπται *as Clephts*. The Clephts (lit. robbers) were those Greeks, who in defiance of the Turkish authorities carried on a predatory warfare from the hills. Many of them were popular heroes, and their existence helped to keep alive the patriotism of the Greeks.
15. τὰ τῶν Τούρκων *the property of the Turks*. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
16. τῶν πρὶν φίλων, see [REF].
17. ὁ κίνδυνος. Introd. Note B. (v.).
18. οὕτω δή *in this way*. δή only emphasises οὕτω, which sums up what precedes. For omission of conjunction, see Introd. Note A. (ii.).

## Section 3.

δεσπότης, [REF].

1. δύο αἰτίαι αἵδε *these two causes*. If a numeral is used, ὅδε does not require the Article to be inserted with the noun, contrary to the rule given on [REF].
2. τοὺς ὑπηκόους *subject peoples* (in general). The Article denotes a whole class. Introd. Note B. (vii.).
3. ἡ τιμωρία τῶν ἀδικιῶν *vengeance for their wrongs*.
4. πρός *against*.
5. διὰ τάδε *for the following reasons*. For the omission of a conjunction in the following sentence, see Introd. Note A. (ii.).
6. πρῶτον μέν is answered by ἔπειτα in [REF]. Introd. Note A. (iv.).
7. ὅτι *that* introduces a noun-clause, after verbs of thinking, knowing, feeling, seeing, saying, etc.
8. αὐτοί *(they) themselves*, cf. [REF] *n*.
9. έχουσι τούς δεσπότας ἀξυνέτους lit. *they have their masters ignorant*, i.e., *the masters they have are ignorant*. ἀξυνέτους is a predicated adjective, and so has no Article. This is the common idiom with ἔχειν
10. ἄδικα πάσχουσιν ὑπό... lit. *suffer unjust things by*, ie., *suffer unjustly at the hands of*. ὑπό with Gen. is the ordinary way of expressing the Agent after Passive Verbs (Lat. *ab* with Abl.); it is also used, as here, with Intransitive Verbs which have a Passive meaning, *are unjustly treated by*.
11. οἷοι τ' εἰσί lit. *are such as to*, i.e., *are able to*; so οἷόν τ' ἐστίν *it is possible*. τε in early Greek was added to Relative words, e.g., ὥστε, and in such cases means nothing at all.
12. δίκην λαμβάνειν παρά... *to take vengeance on*, lit. *to get punishment from*. παρά with Gen. meaning *from* is only used of persons. 
13. οὐδέν... δικαίον *the judges do not care at all either for the laws or for justice*. In Greek two negatives only strengthen one another, provided that the second one is compound. τὸ δίκαιον *justice*. Introd. Note B. (ix.).
14. μετὰ δώρων... *they decide cases with gifts*, i.e., *under the influence of bribes*.
15. εἰσί is understood with ἔμπειροι δέ from the previous clause. In general if a word or group of words is required with two clauses, it is inserted in the first clause and understood in the second.
16. οὕτω. See [REF] *n*.
17. ὧν *of which*; the Rel. Pron. ὅς, ἥ, ὅ is declined in its other cases like the Article with a rough breathing instead of τ, [REF].
18. τὰ μὲν... ἐκ δὲ τῶν. Introd. Note Β. (viii.). 
19. φέρει. Neut. Plurals in Greek take a Singular Verb. This arose from an original use of the Neut. Plur. as a singular collective noun.
20. ἀθάνατον. See [REF] *n*.

The Philiké Hetairia, or Association of Friends, was the successor of the Philomuse Society, which had as its object the encouragement of Greek literature; in 1815, it became a political society for the purpose of raising an insurrection against the Turks. The members, on being initiated, swore on their knees at dead of night to be faithful to their afflicted country, to labour for her regeneration, not to disclose either the secrets of the society or the name of the person who initiated them, and to put to death their nearest and dearest relations, should they be guilty of treachery.-GORDON.

ἥκει . . . μέλλει, had come intended; notice that in nounclauses introduced by or, the original tenses are retained; for instance, in the proclamation Hypsilantes said, I am come... Russia intends, therefore the Present tenses are retained, though we translate them by Past tenses. Cf. 11. 14, 16, and passim.
At the end of the proclamation came these words: "If some desperate Turks venture to make an incursion into your territory, fear nothing; for a Great Power is ready to punish their insolence". The "Great Power" was, of course, Russia.
Page 8, 1. Instead of taking military precautions Hypsilantes commenced operations by seizing a wealthy banker whom he accused of being hostile to the Revolution and concealing funds belonging to the Hetairia. The first accusation was not a crime and the second was false; but the banker was glad to pay the prince several thousand pounds to escape out of his hands. This act of extortion alarmed the wealthy citizens, who, afraid of being robbed by the Greeks, availed themselves of every opportunity of escaping into Russia and Austria

On the other hand it was difficult to know without esteeming him, for even his enemies were forced to confess, that to ardent patriotism he united courage, integrity and humanity, disregarded the allurements of pleasure, and had much goodness of heart, with a steadiness of purpose which at times bordered upon obstinacy."

Page 27, 4. év TO NEOKáσTрo. Navarino had capitulated on 19th Aug. and a dispute arose about searching the Turkish women for jewels which they were supposed to have concealed. "Women wounded with musket balls and sabre cuts rushed to the sea seeking to escape and were deliberately shot. Greeks seized infants from their mothers' breasts and dashed them against the rocks. Children, three and four years old, were hurled living into the sea and left to drown. When the massacre was ended, the dead bodies washed ashore or piled on the beach threatened to cause a pestilence. Phrantzes (a Greek priest) who records these atrocities of his countrymen with shame and indignation, himself hired men to burn the bodies of the victims with the wrecks of some vessels in the harbour."-FINLAY.

Some prisoners were spared for a short time to bury the bodies of their slaughtered countrymen, which were putrefying by thousands in almost every house and garden. Even this precaution was too long neglected. The air was already tainted with a deadly miasma and a terrible epidemic soon broke out among the Greeks."-FINLAY.

The Turks subsequently advanced to Anatolicon, a small town situated in the lagoons, about five miles west of Messalonghi. The inhabitants had been accustomed to get their supplies of drinkingwater from the mainland, as there were no springs on the island of this the Turks were aware, and therefore expected to force it to surrender quickly. A Turkish shell, however, happened to fall on the Church of St. Michael, and, breaking through the pavement, disclosed a spring, which not only supplied sufficient water, but encouraged the people to think that a miracle had been performed on their behalf. After about a month the Turks abandoned the siege.

1.  As an instance of Byron's energy, the following story may be quoted. When he was at Cephalonia, a number of workmen engaged in excavating were buried by the fall of a mass of earth. Byron heard of the accident while at dinner, and rushing to the place seized a spade and by his example stimulated the panic-stricken onlookers to set to work. The result was that all the workmen were rescued.

Byron's ship fell in with a Turkish frigate, but succeeded in getting away to some rocky islands called Scrofes, where Byron concealed himself in a cave. Gamba and his ship were captured, but by a curious coincidence the captain of the Turkish frigate had once been saved from death by the Greek skipper, and, in gratitude for this, he pretended that he saw nothing suspicious about the vessel, and let it continue its voyage.

Botzares, and, having no written permission to enter, was stopped by the sentry. He persisted in going in, and the officer on guard ordered him to be arrested; a quarrel ensued, and the Souliote, having received a blow, killed the officer on the spot. In an instant alarm pervaded the town: the Souliotes rose to arms, threatening to storm the armoury and even Byron's house, if their countryman, who had been apprehended, was not set at liberty. The riot was at length appeased, but Byron declared that he would return to the Ionian islands if the Souliotes did not leave Messalonghi.—GORDON.

On 9th April Byron went out to ride near the town and was overtaken by a heavy shower, and returned home in a boat. Shortly afterwards he complained of fever: the doctors prescribed bleeding, but he refused, saying, “I will drink all your medicines, but not one drop of my blood will I shed. All of it shall be shed on the field of battle." Delirium came on, then stupor, and at six o'clock in the afternoon of Easter Monday (19th April) at the instant of an awful thunderstorm Byron expired.
His coffin was laid by the side of the grave of M. Botzares, but as he expressed a wish to be buried in the tomb of his ancestors (at Hucknall Torkard, near Nottingham), the body was removed to England, and his heart interred at Messalonghi.

At four o'clock in the afternoon, a soldier, bearing a lighted match, was seen to leave the monastery and run towards the entrance of a great subterraneous magazine, situated outside-he fell, pierced with balls, and five of his companions, following his example, one after the other, shared his fate. Unable to execute their first project, the Greeks resolved to inflame the powder they had within the monastery. They ceased their fire, and the Turks darting on, sword in hand, scaled the walls on every side; when suddenly the Hellenic flag was lowered, a white banner, inscribed with the words 'Liberty or Death,' waved in the air, a single gun gave the signal, and a tremendous explosion, shaking the island and felt far out at sea, buried in the ruins of St. Nicholas thousands of the conquerors and the conquered!"-Gordon.

When the Turks retired from Messalonghi (Section 36), they buried their guns, and erected tombstones over them: the Greeks were deceived by this stratagem, and proudly pointed to the inscriptions which recorded the fate of their enemies.
